We made this app to resurrect our Little Printers from the dead. [Download it from the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/little-printers/id1393105914?ls=1&mt=8)!

For more information, check out the [project page](https://nordprojects.co/projects/littleprinters) on our website!

## Developing

The app is written in Swift, and uses CocoaPods for dependency management. 

Pods are checked into git, so no need to 'pod install'. Just open `littleprinter.xcworkspace` to get started.
